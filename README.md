# List-Binders

## Description

Use either SingleViewTypeAdapter to create simple lists, or MultiViewTypeAdapter for lists with multiple view types.

## TODO

- Decide if convertion to Kotlin is necessary, at least for sample.

- Sublist item?

- What if you were using stableID for viewType? Would that be possible somehow?
